# Console-Based Games in Java

This repository contains several console-based games implemented in **Java** during my internship at **TechnoHacks EduTech**. Each game is built using the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and incorporates **exception handling** to ensure smooth gameplay. These projects include classic games such as **Rock Paper Scissors**, **Tic Tac Toe**, **Number Guessing**, and a **Quiz Game**.

## Project Overview üéÆ

The games included in this project are:
1. **Rock Paper Scissors Game**: The classic hand game, played between the user and the computer.
2. **Tic Tac Toe Game**: The famous two-player game played on a 3x3 grid.
3. **Number Guessing Game**: The user attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of tries.
4. **Quiz Game**: A simple quiz game that asks multiple-choice questions and tracks the score.

These projects demonstrate:
- **Exception Handling** to manage invalid inputs and ensure a smooth gameplay experience.
- **Modular and reusable code** for each game.
